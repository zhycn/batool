# Batool

### Find it. Link it. Go.

This shouldn’t be necessary.  
But the web is drowning in middlemen—ads, trackers, “top 10” lists that lead nowhere.

So we built something simple:  
A place where every tool lives as a single, honest link.  
You find it. You link it. You go—straight to the source. No detours. No distractions.

It’s static. It’s open. It’s yours.  
Deploy it. Fork it. Make it your own gateway.

If you believe access should be direct…  
this is for you.
